# Void-of-Course
A 2D non-traditional platforming game about bouncy planets, in development with GMS2.
## How can I play?
If you have GameMaker Studio 2, you can clone/download this repository and try it out. However, it is heavily under development, and the first executible release will coincide with the official release.
## When will it officially come out?
The full version will likely be ready around Summer of 2020, but it will be ready when it is ready :)
## How much will it cost on release?
The game will be free, and downloadable from itch.io. I will include a link here when it is completely finished.
